tanks:
    - match or battle royale
    - powerups or different tanks
    - map generation
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm
            - I like the Recursive division method as it has a high density of tunnels
            - Has python and C exmaples
                - I will change to JS for fun why not
        - dynamic:
            - generate at runtime
                - differing experience
            - generate several in advance
                - i.e
            - generate one every day/week/month
            - one static maze
                - higher skill ceiling?
